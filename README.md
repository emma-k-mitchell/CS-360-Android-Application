# CS-360-Android-Application
## Project Secnario and Development
My work on this project introduced me to Android mobile development using Android Studio. The goal of the project was to design, develop, and launch a fully functional mobile application. Development took place over 7 weeks. The application I developed was one of three options that I was able to choose at the begining of the class.

I developed a weight tracking application that allows a user to create an account, login, and track weights using a grid. An additional requirement was requesting permission from the user to communicate using SMS messages for important notifications. There are two main screens of my app, the login screen and grid screen. I will include screenshots of both below.

[INCLUDE SCREENSHOTS HERE LATER]
