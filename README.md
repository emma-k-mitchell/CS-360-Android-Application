# CS-360-Android-Application
## Project Secnario and Development
My work on this project introduced me to Android mobile development using Android Studio. The goal of the project was to design, develop, and launch a fully functional mobile application. Development took place over 7 weeks. The application I developed was one of three options that I was able to choose at the begining of the class.

I developed a weight tracking application that allows a user to create an account, login, and track weights using a grid. An additional requirement was requesting permission from the user to communicate using SMS messages for important notifications. There are two main screens of my app, the login screen and grid screen. I will include screenshots of both below.

## How did I approach developing the code for this application?
Work for this application was divided into three sections: research/planning, UI design, and code development. Most of the work for this project was done while developing the code, but a section of the code was written while designing the UI for the app. I started my work early so that I had time to impliment what was required and have additional time to go beyond the requirments and improve upon the app. I wanted to design an application that met requirements and was somthing that I would be proud of.
## How did I test my code?
I tested my code by using the app I developed. For example, when I added a login screen with user authenticiation, I used the app to test all possible scenarios for a user that was logging in and/or creating a new account. When I found an error, I would go back into my code and take the time to understand what was wrong, and the correct way to fix the problem.
## How did I overcome challenges?
The biggest challenege I faced in this class was my inexperience. I addressed this by watching tutorials on YouTube from thoes with more experience than I. In doing so, I gained alot of experience with practical coding techniques.
## What experience have I gained from this class?
This was my first introduction to Android mobile application development, so everything I learned from this class was good experience. My code was mostly done in Java, and I used Android Studio for the first time as well. More than anything, I think I discovered that I have a passion for developing applications.
